# Godot-Block-Puzzle

A quick block puzzle game created in the Godot game engine. Check 'releases' to download and play on Windows or Android.

This is my first project using Godot and was finished within a week of starting it. I have learnt a lot about the engine and GDScript during the development of this game.
I will further my knowledge by creating a few more similar, small games in the coming months.
